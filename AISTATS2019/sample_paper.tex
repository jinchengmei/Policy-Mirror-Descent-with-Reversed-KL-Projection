\subsubsection{Citations in Text}

Citations within the text should include the author's last name and
year, e.g., (Cheesman, 1985). References should follow any style that
you are used to using, as long as their style is consistent throughout
the paper.  Be sure that the sentence reads correctly if the citation
is deleted: e.g., instead of ``As described by (Cheesman, 1985), we
first frobulate the widgets,'' write ``As described by Cheesman
(1985), we first frobulate the widgets.''  %Be sure to avoid
%accidentally disclosing author identities through citations.

Make sure that the figure caption does not get separated from the
figure. Leave extra white space at the bottom of the page rather than
splitting the figure and figure caption.
\begin{figure}[h]
\vspace{.3in}
\centerline{\fbox{This figure intentionally left non-blank}}
\vspace{.3in}
\caption{Sample Figure Caption}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered, neat, clean, and legible. Do not use hand-drawn tables.
Table number and title always appear above the table.
See Table~\ref{sample-table}.

Use one line space before the table title, one line space after the table title,
and one line space after the table. The table title must be
initial caps and each table numbered consecutively.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Sample Table Title} \label{sample-table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{PART}  &\textbf{DESCRIPTION} \\
\hline \\
Dendrite         &Input terminal \\
Axon             &Output terminal \\
Soma             &Cell body (contains cell nucleus) \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\section{SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL}

If you need to include additional appendices during submission, you
can include them in the supplementary material file.



\section{INSTRUCTIONS FOR CAMERA-READY PAPERS}

For the camera-ready paper, if you are using \LaTeX, please make sure
that you follow these instructions.  (If you are not using \LaTeX,
please make sure to achieve the same effect using your chosen
typesetting package.)

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Download \texttt{fancyhdr.sty} -- the
    \texttt{aistats2019.sty} file will make use of it.
    \item Begin your document with
    \begin{flushleft}
    \texttt{\textbackslash documentclass[twoside]\{article\}}\\
    \texttt{\textbackslash usepackage[accepted]\{aistats2019\}}
    \end{flushleft}
    The \texttt{twoside} option for the class article allows the
    package \texttt{fancyhdr.sty} to include headings for even and odd
    numbered pages. The option \texttt{accepted} for the package
    \texttt{aistats2019.sty} will write a copyright notice at the end of
    the first column of the first page. This option will also print
    headings for the paper.  For the \emph{even} pages, the title of
    the paper will be used as heading and for \emph{odd} pages the
    author names will be used as heading.  If the title of the paper
    is too long or the number of authors is too large, the style will
    print a warning message as heading. If this happens additional
    commands can be used to place as headings shorter versions of the
    title and the author names. This is explained in the next point.
    \item  If you get warning messages as described above, then
    immediately after $\texttt{\textbackslash
    begin\{document\}}$, write
    \begin{flushleft}
    \texttt{\textbackslash runningtitle\{Provide here an alternative
    shorter version of the title of your paper\}}\\
    \texttt{\textbackslash runningauthor\{Provide here the surnames of
    the authors of your paper, all separated by commas\}}
    \end{flushleft}
    Note that the text that appears as argument in \texttt{\textbackslash
      runningtitle} will be printed as a heading in the \emph{even}
    pages. The text that appears as argument in \texttt{\textbackslash
      runningauthor} will be printed as a heading in the \emph{odd}
    pages.  If even the author surnames do not fit, it is acceptable
    to give a subset of author names followed by ``et al.''

    \item Use the file sample\_paper.tex as an example.

    \item The camera-ready versions of the accepted papers are 8
      pages, plus any additional pages needed for references.

    \item If you need to include additional appendices,
      you can include them in the supplementary
      material file.

    \item Please, don't change the layout given by the above
      instructions and by the style file.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Acknowledgements}

Use the unnumbered third level heading for the acknowledgements.  All
acknowledgements go at the end of the paper.

\subsubsection*{References}

References follow the acknowledgements.  Use an unnumbered third level
heading for the references section.  Any choice of citation style is
acceptable as long as you are consistent.  Please use the same font
size for references as for the body of the paper---remember that
references do not count against your page length total.
